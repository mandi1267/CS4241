Events:
In my assignment, I listen for double click, touch start, touch end, key press, and key down events. Bubbling is used to detect double clicks on both the canvas and the page body. These are used to restart the game of snake and change the theme respectively (stopPropagation could be done in the canvas double click listener if it would be better not to change the theme when restarting a game, but I wanted to make sure to demonstrate that both double click listeners could intercept the double click event).

Theming Choices:
I have 3 different themes that can be switched between. The first is a plain theme with a grey background and purple accents.
The second is a winter theme, which is blue and white.
The last is a holiday theme, which is white and red.

Technical Achievement:
For my technical achievement, I made a simple variant of the snake game. This involved using an html canvas and starting timers, as well as the logic for the game. I also was able to change the style sheet programatically.
