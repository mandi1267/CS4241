Theming Choices:
I updated the theme from the previous assignments to have a top bar and two columns. I use the color scheme at this site: https://color.adobe.com/library/25ee34fa-748a-4011-a1ab-5d3cc5eb1a5e/theme/929bdd6e-aa4d-40e9-9ecf-3cae9aba178e/

Technical Achievement
Sorting columns: I enabled sorting the rows of the table. On the first click of a table heading, it'll sort the column in ascending order. Subsequent clicks to the same column will toggle ascending/descending order.
Inline editing: If you click on a cell in the table, it turns into a text box and can be edited. Editing mode is left if the user moves their mouse outside the text box. To submit a change, press enter.
URL modification: I enabled modifying the URL when the user searches for something. The URL is encoded with the search term and the field to search by. If the search is cleared, or an add occurs, the URL is reset to the main page.
